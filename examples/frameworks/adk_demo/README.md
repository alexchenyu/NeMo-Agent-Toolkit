# Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Example

A minimal example using Agent Development Kit showcasing a simple weather time agent that can call tools (a function tool and an MCP tool).

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent Toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the NAT library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[adk]' --prerelease=allow
uv pip install -e examples/frameworks/adk_demo
```

### Set Up API Keys

Since Google ADK uses LiteLLM, you can use whichever model that is supported by LiteLLM. Please set the appropriate environment variables for the model you want to use.

For example, to use an OpenAI model, you will need an OpenAI API key. Visit [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and create an account. Navigate to your account settings to obtain your OpenAI API key. Copy the key and set it as an environment variable using the following command:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```

You can find LLM provider specific instructions in the LiteLLM documentation. Please set the appropriate environment variables.

### Run the Workflow

#### Set up the MCP server
This example also demonstrates how NAT can interact with MCP servers on behalf of ADK.

First run the MCP server with this command.

```bash
nat mcp --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 9901 \
  --name "My MCP Server"
```

Then run the workflow with the NAT CLI

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/frameworks/adk_demo/configs/config.yml --input "What is the weather and time in New York today?"
```

**Expected Output**

```console
The weather in New York today is sunny with a high of 75°F and a low of 60°F.
```
